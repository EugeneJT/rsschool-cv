## About

I'm Frontend Developer with more than 3 years of commercial experience.
I create successful websites that are fast, easy to use, and built with best practices.
I write standards-based code that is semantic, accessible, search-engine friendly, easy to maintain, cross-browser compatible, and performant.
I have a special interest in use of animation on the web. I particularly like working on websites that have seamless transitions and require high-level performance to maintain a smooth and appealing website.

Now I'm Frontend Developer from Veeam Software. And I've been here for 2 years. My responsibility are to:

* the daily production of Landing pages and HTML emails
* make regular changes to existing ones
* uphold quality layout according to corporate guidelines
* make recommendations to optimize and streamline their HTML templates
* work collaboratively with other developers/designers
* Maintaining and promoting a successful and positive work environment.
* Research and implements new tools and technologies
